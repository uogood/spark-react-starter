* Hot reloading with [React Hot Loader v3 beta](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/pull/61)
* Redux
* React Router
* Hapi.js server with a basic index page powered by pug (aka jade)
* Isomorphic app/server rendering
* Eslint rules (mostly based on airbnb config)
* Mocha tests + test coverage reporting

# What's to come?

* More test utilities + more tests (aiming for high test coverage)
* Better documentation
